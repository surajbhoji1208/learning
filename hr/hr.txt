"Hi, my name is Suraj Bhoji. I completed my Bachelor of Technology in Information Technology
 from Dr. J.J. Magdum College of Engineering in 2022 with a GPA of 8.0. Currently, 
 I am working as a Software Engineer at OneClick IT Consultancy Pvt Ltd in Ahmedabad,
  where I have around two years of experience in full-stack development.
My technical expertise includes Angular, React.js, Node.js, NestJS, PostgreSQL, and Java. 
I have been involved in both frontend and backend projects database schema planning, API development, and performance optimization.
For example, in one of my key projects, Elite Opinio, I migrated an Angular application from v11 to v15,
 optimized page speed by 30% using lazy loading and AOT compilation,
  and developed a reporting module with Bull Queues for large dataset processing.
   On the backend, I optimized PostgreSQL queries and indexing, reducing response time by 30%.
I also worked on a React-based project called Opinio Volt, where I designed the overall project architecture, 
built reusable components, managed state using Redux, and implemented React Router with lazy loading for code-splitting.
 I deployed the application on Vercel and ensured responsiveness across all pages, including About, Careers, 
 and Login/Logout flows.
In addition to development, I have participated in Agile ceremonies, client communication,
 and conducted technical interviews for Node.js and Angular roles. I enjoy building scalable,
  user-centric solutions and continuously work on improving my skills in both frontend and backend development.




  2)switch
  In my current role, I’ve worked on end-to-end development, optimized applications, and even contributed to technical hiring.
   I’m now looking for a role where I can further enhance my skills, especially in advanced React, Node.js, and cloud-based architectures.
   I see this opportunity as a way to continue learning while also adding value with my current experience

   3)Yes, I did receive my appraisal in April, and I’m grateful to my current company for recognizing my contributions. 
   However, for me, career growth is not only about salary but also about the kind of projects, technologies, 
   and responsibilities I get to work on. That’s why I’m exploring opportunities where I can challenge myself more,
    enhance my skills, and contribute at a larger scale
    — and I feel this role aligns well with those goals.



    4)project
    surveying platform where our application acts as middleware between clients and vendors. 
    For example, when a client wants to run a survey but doesn’t have enough users to complete it,
     we connect them with vendors who already have a large user base. We integrated tier-one companies into our panel
      to ensure reliable vendor support.
Here’s how it works: the client registers in our panel with survey details, 
and our system automatically assigns the survey to suitable vendors based on client requirements. 
Vendors then provide users to complete those surveys. On average, our platform handles 1 to 2 lakh users per day, 
so we needed to ensure high performance and almost zero downtime —
 because even a little downtime could cause significant loss for the client.
To achieve this, I worked on optimizing APIs, PostgreSQL queries, and backend processes,
 and implemented features like Bull Queues for background processing and cron jobs for scheduled updates. 
 We also ensured smooth communication between frontend and backend using Angular/React and Node.js.
  The focus was always on scalability, reliability, and performance, which helped us manage the heavy traffic efficiently.
