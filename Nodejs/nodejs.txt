üîπ 4. File System and Streams
How do you read and write files in Node.js?
=>In Node.js, reading and writing files is commonly done using the built-in fs (File System) module
    ‚úÖ Asynchronous (Non-blocking) - Preferred
            fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
            if (err) {
                console.error('Error reading file:', err);
                return;
            }
            console.log('File content:', data);
            });

    ‚úÖ Synchronous (Blocking)

            try {
            const data = fs.readFileSync('example.txt', 'utf8');
            console.log('File content:', data);
            } catch (err) {
            console.error('Error reading file:', err);
            }

What are the differences between fs.readFile() and fs.readFileSync()?
=>1. Synchronous (Sync)
    Blocks the execution of further code until the file operation completes.
    Slower for large files or heavy tasks.
    Use it only when you must wait before continuing.
 2. Asynchronous (Async)
    Non-blocking ‚Äî code doesn‚Äôt wait for the file operation to complete.
    A callback function (or Promise) handles the result when it's ready.
    Preferred in most real-world apps for better performance.

The error message:

csharp
Copy
Edit
git : The term 'git' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet...
means that Git is not installed on your system, or it‚Äôs not added to your system's PATH.

‚úÖ Solution Steps:
Step 1: Check if Git is Installed
Open a new Command Prompt or PowerShell window.

Type:

css
Copy
Edit
git --version
If it says something like:
git is not recognized as an internal or external command...

then Git is not installed.

üîß Step 2: Install Git for Windows
Go to the official Git website:
üëâ https://git-scm.com/download/win

Download the Git installer and run it.

In the setup:

Use recommended options unless you know what you're changing.

Make sure the option "Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software" is selected.

üîÅ Step 3: Restart Terminal & Try Again
After installation:

Restart PowerShell or Command Prompt.

Try:

bash
Copy
Edit
git --version
You should now see the installed Git version.

Then retry your clone:

bash
Copy
