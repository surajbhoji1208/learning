What is semantic versioning (^, ~, *) in package.json?

ðŸ”¹ 4. File System and Streams
How do you read and write files in Node.js?
=>In Node.js, reading and writing files is commonly done using the built-in fs (File System) module
    âœ… Asynchronous (Non-blocking) - Preferred
            fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
            if (err) {
                console.error('Error reading file:', err);
                return;
            }
            console.log('File content:', data);
            });

    âœ… Synchronous (Blocking)

            try {
            const data = fs.readFileSync('example.txt', 'utf8');
            console.log('File content:', data);
            } catch (err) {
            console.error('Error reading file:', err);
            }

What are the differences between fs.readFile() and fs.readFileSync()?
=>1. Synchronous (Sync)
    Blocks the execution of further code until the file operation completes.
    Slower for large files or heavy tasks.
    Use it only when you must wait before continuing.
 2. Asynchronous (Async)
    Non-blocking â€” code doesnâ€™t wait for the file operation to complete.
    A callback function (or Promise) handles the result when it's ready.
    Preferred in most real-world apps for better performance.
