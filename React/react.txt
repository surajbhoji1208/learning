Basic Level
What is React.js? How does it work?
=>React js is javascript library which is developed by meta and it is used to create single page application 

What are the key features of React?
=>jsx,virtual dom for better performance, react hooks , react routing, these are key features of react 

What is JSX? How is it different from HTML?
=>JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It’s a syntax extension for JavaScript that lets us write HTML-like code directly inside JavaScript files. 
  It’s most commonly used in React to define how the UI should look.
  Transpiled by Babel”
  “Improves readability and maintainability”
  “Supports JS expressions inside {}”

What is the Virtual DOM, and how does it improve performance?
=>The Virtual DOM is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the actual DOM.
 In React, instead of manipulating the real DOM directly every time there’s a change, React creates a copy of the DOM in memory — that’s the Virtual DOM.
  When the app’s state changes, React updates this Virtual DOM first. Then,
  it compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous one using a process called diffing. Based on the differences, React calculates the most efficient way to update the real DOM.
   This makes UI updates faster and more efficient because it reduces expensive direct DOM manipulations.
  This approach improves performance because working with the real DOM is slow compared to working with objects in memory. 
  By batching changes and minimizing direct updates, React delivers a smoother, more responsive UI.”**


What are functional and class components?
=>React has two type of component 
    1)function 2)class
    1)functional : it is pure js function has no its own state
                    react hooks give spacial power to manage state
                    it is lightweight
                    it return jsx 
    2)class component: it is js class that extend component
                        it uses render method to return jsx
                        it has its own life cycle method

What is the difference between state and props?
=>states are special function in react which is help to use control lifecycle of component
  State is a local, mutable data storage inside a component
  It allows a component to track and manage its own data.
  Props are like function args, data are pass to component to component with parent child relation 
  Props are read-only data passed from a parent component to a child component.


What are React Hooks? Can you name a few?
=>  Allows functional components to use state & lifecycle features
    Simplifies component logic (No need for class components)
    Avoids using this (Easier to read & debug)
    Improves performance by reducing unnecessary re-renders

      1️⃣ useState – For managing state.
      2️⃣ useEffect – For side effects (API calls, subscriptions).
      3️⃣ useContext – For avoiding prop drilling.
      4️⃣ useRef – For accessing DOM elements.
      5️⃣ useReducer – For complex state management.

What is the difference between useState and useReducer?
    Both useState and useReducer are React hooks used for state management in functional components. However, useState is best for simple state updates, while useReducer is useful for managing complex state logic."
    useState is a basic hook that allows components to store and update state directly. It's best for simple state values like numbers, booleans, or strings.
    useReducer is useful when state logic involves multiple related values or complex updates. Instead of directly updating the state, it uses a reducer function to handle actions and return a new state.

What is the significance of key props in lists?
=> Keys help React minimize DOM operations. If a list changes, React can match the old and new elements using the key, 
   so it only updates what’s necessary instead of re-rendering the whole list
   Good keys: Unique and stable. Usually an ID from your data (id or uuid).
   Bad keys: Using an index (key={index}) is not ideal because the index can change if you add, remove, or reorder items. That can break the mapping.

Intermediate Level
What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components?
=>      ➡️ Controlled Component
        In a controlled component, React controls the form element’s value.
        The value is bound to React state.
        When the user types, an onChange handler updates the state, which updates the input’s value.
        ➡️ Uncontrolled Component
        In an uncontrolled component, the DOM itself keeps track of the value.
        React does not directly manage the input’s current value.
        You use a ref to read the value when needed.

What are Higher-Order Components (HOC)?
=>Higher order component is react pattern which accept component as args and return new component with new props or new feature
  it do not modify original component directly

How does React handle forms and form validation?
=>controlled and uncontrolled Explain

What is the Context API? How is it different from Redux?
=>It build in react feature to share data globally without having to pass props manually at every Level
  Used to avoid prop drilling
  It is good for simple global state
  used to share data globally like: User auth status, theme(light/dark)
  Redux: its a external library
         good for complex management 
         provide way to update,debug globally

What is Prop Drilling, and how do you avoid it?
=>Prop Drilling happens when you have to pass data through multiple layers of components,
  even if intermediate components don’t care about that data — they’re just passing it down.

What is the difference between useEffect and componentDidMount?
=>componentDidMount is a lifecycle method in class-based components.
  It runs once, after the component is rendered to the DOM.
  Typical use: fetch data, set up subscriptions, run side effects that should only happen once.
  useEffect is a Hook in function components.
  It can mimic multiple lifecycle behaviors, including:componentDidMount,componentDidUpdate,componentWillUnmount


Explain React's reconciliation process.

What is React Router, and how do you implement dynamic routes?

What is memoization in React? How does React.memo work?

What are custom hooks? Can you give an example?

why we always have to write supper(props) in class based component while receiving props
=>In class based component we extends React.Component class
  so before use props we have to define props 
  it is going to define in parent class component
  for that we have to call parent class component constructor
  for that we have to call supper(props) inside class constructor
  Then with the help of this.props we can use props
