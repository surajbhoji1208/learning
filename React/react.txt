Basic Level
Q)What is React.js? How does it work?
=>"React.js is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Meta, mainly for building single-page applications
   with reusable components.
   It works using a virtual DOM, where changes are first applied to the virtual DOM and then efficiently 
   updated in the real DOM through reconciliation. This makes UI updates faster and more optimized." 

Q)What are the key features of React?
=>jsx,virtual dom for better performance, react hooks , react routing, these are key features of react 

Q)What is JSX? How is it different from HTML?
=>JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It’s a syntax extension for JavaScript that lets us write HTML-like code directly inside JavaScript files. 
  It’s most commonly used in React to define how the UI should look.
  Transpiled by Babel”
  “Improves readability and maintainability”
  “Supports JS expressions inside {}”

Q)What is the Virtual DOM, and how does it improve performance?
=>The Virtual DOM is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the actual DOM.
 In React, instead of updating the real DOM directly whenever something changes, React updates the Virtual DOM first.
 When the application’s state changes:
    React updates the Virtual DOM.
      It then compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous one using a process called diffing.
      Based on the differences, React calculates the minimum number of changes needed.
      Finally, it updates only those specific parts of the real DOM — not the entire UI.

Q)What are functional and class components?
=>React has two type of component 
    1)function 2)class
    1)functional : it is pure js function has no its own state
                    react hooks give spacial power to manage state
                    it is lightweight
                    it return jsx 
    2)class component: it is js class that extend component
                        it uses render method to return jsx
                        it has its own life cycle method

Q)What is the difference between state and props?
=>states are special function in react which is help to use control lifecycle of component
  State is a local, mutable data storage inside a component
  It allows a component to track and manage its own data.
  Props are like function args, data are pass to component to component with parent child relation 
  Props are read-only data passed from a parent component to a child component.


Q)What are React Hooks? Can you name a few?
=>  Allows functional components to use state & lifecycle features
    Simplifies component logic (No need for class components)
    Avoids using this (Easier to read & debug)
    Improves performance by reducing unnecessary re-renders

      1️⃣ useState – For managing state.
      2️⃣ useEffect – For side effects (API calls, subscriptions).
      3️⃣ useContext – For avoiding prop drilling.
      4️⃣ useRef – For accessing DOM elements.
      5️⃣ useReducer – For complex state management.

Q)What is the difference between useState and useReducer?
    Both useState and useReducer are React hooks used for state management in functional components. However, useState is best for simple state updates, while useReducer is useful for managing complex state logic."
    useState is a basic hook that allows components to store and update state directly. It's best for simple state values like numbers, booleans, or strings.
    useReducer is useful when state logic involves multiple related values or complex updates. Instead of directly updating the state, it uses a reducer function to handle actions and return a new state.

Q)What is the significance of key props in lists?
=> Keys help React minimize DOM operations. If a list changes, React can match the old and new elements using the key, 
   so it only updates what’s necessary instead of re-rendering the whole list
   Good keys: Unique and stable. Usually an ID from your data (id or uuid).
   Bad keys: Using an index (key={index}) is not ideal because the index can change if you add, remove, or reorder items. That can break the mapping.

Intermediate Level
Q)What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components?
=>      ➡️ Controlled Component
        In a controlled component, React controls the form element’s value.
        The value is bound to React state.
        When the user types, an onChange handler updates the state, which updates the input’s value.
        ➡️ Uncontrolled Component
        In an uncontrolled component, the DOM itself keeps track of the value.
        React does not directly manage the input’s current value.
        You use a ref to read the value when needed.

Q)What are Higher-Order Components (HOC)?
=>Higher order component is react pattern which accept component as args and return new component with new props or new feature
  it do not modify original component directly

Q)How does React handle forms and form validation?
=>controlled and uncontrolled Explain

Q)What is the Context API? How is it different from Redux?
=>It build in react feature to share data globally without having to pass props manually at every Level
  Used to avoid prop drilling
  It is good for simple global state
  used to share data globally like: User auth status, theme(light/dark)
  Redux: its a external library
         good for complex management 
         provide way to update,debug globally

Q)What is Prop Drilling, and how do you avoid it?
=>Prop Drilling happens when you have to pass data through multiple layers of components,
  even if intermediate components don’t care about that data — they’re just passing it down.

Q)What is the difference between useEffect and componentDidMount?
=>componentDidMount is a lifecycle method in class-based components.
  It runs once, after the component is rendered to the DOM.
  Typical use: fetch data, set up subscriptions, run side effects that should only happen once.
  useEffect is a Hook in function components.
  It can mimic multiple lifecycle behaviors, including:componentDidMount,componentDidUpdate,componentWillUnmount


Q)Explain React's reconciliation process.
=>React's reconciliation process is the algorithm it uses to update the DOM efficiently when the state or props of a component change.
  Instead of re-rendering the whole UI from scratch, React uses a virtual DOM to track changes. When something changes:
  React creates a new virtual DOM tree.
  It compares this new tree with the previous one using a process called diffing.
  Based on the difference, it calculates the minimal number of changes required.
  React then updates only those parts of the real DOM that have changed.

Q)What is React Router, and how do you implement dynamic routes?
=>React Router is a standard routing library for React. It enables navigation between different views or pages in a React application without          reloading the page, by managing the URL and rendering the appropriate components.
  It provides components like <BrowserRouter>, <Routes>, <Route>, and hooks like useNavigate and useParams to handle navigation and access route-      related data.
Dynamic Routes:
                    Dynamic routes are used when the path includes a variable segment, such as a user ID or product ID.
                    
                    Example:
                    <Route path="/user/:id" element={<UserProfile />} />
                    Here, :id is a dynamic segment.
                    
                    🧠 How to Access Dynamic Route Params:
                    Inside the UserProfile component, you can access the id using the useParams() hook:
                    
                    import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';
                    
                    function UserProfile() {
                      const { id } = useParams();
                      return <h2>User ID: {id}</h2>;
                    }
                    This will display User ID: 123 if the user visits /user/123.

Q)What is memoization in React? How does React.memo work?
=>Memoization in React is an optimization technique used to avoid unnecessary re-renders of components by caching the result of a component or
         function based on its inputs (props).
  React.memo is a Higher-Order Component (HOC) that allows functional components to skip re-rendering if their props haven't changed.
  It works like this:                  
                      const MemoizedComponent = React.memo(MyComponent);
                      Now, MyComponent will only re-render if its props change — based on a shallow comparison.
 
Q)What problem are useMemo & useCallback solving?
=>React re-renders a component every time its parent re-renders.
  During every render:
    every variable is recreated
    every object/array/function gets a new reference
    logic/calculations re-run

  This causes:
    unnecessary expensive calculations
    child components receiving new references → re-render unnecessarily
    performance issues in complex UI
    useMemo and useCallback solve this


Q)What are custom hooks? Can you give an example?
=>explain toggel example

Q)why we always have to write supper(props) in class based component while receiving props
=>In class based component we extends React.Component class
  so before use props we have to define props 
  it is going to define in parent class component
  for that we have to call parent class component constructor
  for that we have to call supper(props) inside class constructor
  Then with the help of this.props we can use props 

Advanced Level
Q)What is the difference between Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Client-Side Rendering (CSR)?
=> In CSR, the browser (client) downloads a minimal HTML page, then runs JavaScript to render the content dynamically.
      How it works:
        User requests a web page.
        Server responds with a basic HTML + JavaScript bundle.
        Browser runs JavaScript (usually React, Angular, etc.) to build the UI.
        Content is shown after JS is executed
   In SSR, the server renders the full HTML content of the page and sends it to the browser, which just displays it.
      How it works:
        User requests a web page.
        Server processes the request and sends fully rendered HTML.
        Browser displays content immediately.
        JavaScript hydrates the page to make it interactive.

Q)How does React Fiber improve performance?
=>React Fiber is a complete rewrite of the React core algorithm introduced in React 16. It was designed to improve performance, especially for complex UI rendering, animation, and responsive interactions.
  1. Incremental Rendering
      Old React: Rendering was synchronous and blocking — once it started rendering, it had to finish.
      Fiber: Breaks rendering into small units of work (called "fibers") that can be paused and resumed
  2. Prioritized Updates
      Fiber assigns priority levels to updates (e.g., animation > data fetch).
      Important updates (like typing or clicking) can interrupt low-priority work.
  3. Concurrency Support
      React Fiber is designed for concurrent rendering, a foundation for features like useTransition, 
      startTransition, and React Concurrent Mode.
  4. Improved Scheduling
      Fiber uses a cooperative scheduling model.
      It can yield control back to the browser to handle higher-priority tasks like animations or user input.

      Lifecycle with Fiber
          Two main phases:
          1. Render Phase (can be paused)
              Calculate changes
              Prepare the work
          2. Commit Phase (cannot be paused)
              Apply changes to DOM




Q)What is concurrent mode in React?
=>-Concurrent Mode is an optional advanced feature in React (enabled by React Fiber) that allows React to work on multiple tasks at the same time,
    making apps more responsive and interruptible.
  -Concurrent Mode lets React prepare multiple versions of the UI in the background and decide which one to show — without blocking the main thread.
   How to Use Concurrent Features
    You don't enable "Concurrent Mode" like a switch anymore. Instead, it's enabled automatically when you use concurrent features like:
    startTransition()
    useTransition()
    useDeferredValue()
    Suspense + lazy
 
Q)How do you optimize performance in a React application?
=>React provides multiple ways to optimize performance, especially for large applications. Some common techniques are:
    Avoid unnecessary re-renders
        Use React.memo to memoize functional components.
        Use useCallback to memoize callback functions.
        Use useMemo to memoize expensive calculations.
    Code Splitting and Lazy Loading
        Use React.lazy + Suspense to load components only when needed.
        Split bundles using tools like Webpack or Vite.
    Virtualization for large lists
        Use libraries like react-window or react-virtualized to render only visible items instead of the entire list.
    Optimize Context and State Management
        Keep state as local as possible.
        Avoid prop drilling using Context or Redux.
        Split contexts if they cause too many re-renders.
    Use Concurrent Features (React 18+)
        startTransition / useTransition to defer non-urgent updates.
        useDeferredValue for smoother typing in search inputs.
    Efficient DOM Updates
        eact already optimizes with the Virtual DOM, but you can further reduce costly DOM operations by batching state updates.
    Image and Asset Optimization
        Use compressed images, SVGs, lazy loading for images (loading="lazy").
        Serve assets via CDN.
    Memoization of Selectors (Redux)
        Use reselect or RTK selectors to prevent unnecessary recalculations.

Q)Explain how React works with Webpack and Babel.
=>React itself is just a JavaScript library, but modern React applications use Webpack and Babel in the build process to make development easier.
  Babel
    React uses JSX, which browsers don’t understand directly.
    Babel is a JavaScript compiler that transpiles JSX into plain JavaScript (React.createElement() calls).
    It also converts modern ES6+ code (like arrow functions, async/await) into older JavaScript that browsers can run.
  Webpack
    Webpack is a module bundler.
    It takes all React components, CSS, images, and other files and bundles them into a single file (or smaller chunks).
    It supports loaders (like babel-loader) to process files before bundling.
    It also handles code splitting (lazy loading) for better performance.
  How they work together with React
    When you write React code (JSX + ES6+), Babel transpiles it into plain JavaScript.
    Webpack bundles everything (including Babel output, CSS, images) into optimized files.
    The browser then runs this bundled JavaScript to render your React app.
