✅ 1. Angular Basics (10 questions)
What is Angular and how is it different from AngularJS?

What are components in Angular?
=> In Angular, a component is the basic building block of the UI. It controls a specific part of the screen called a view. Each component is made up of three main parts:
Template (HTML) → defines the UI.
Class (TypeScript) → contains the logic and data.
Metadata (Decorator @Component) → tells Angular how to process the component.

What is the role of NgModule in Angular?
=>NgModule plays a central role in organizing an application into cohesive blocks of functionality. 
  It's a decorator that defines a module, which is a container for a group of related components, directives, pipes, and services.

What is the Angular lifecycle hook? Name a few important ones.
  -In Angular, lifecycle hooks are special methods that allow you to tap into key moments in a component's or directive’s lifecycle 
   Most Commonly Used Hooks
    ngOnInit() — for initialization logic.
    ngOnDestroy() — for teardown/cleanup.
    ngOnChanges() — for responding to input changes.
    ngAfterViewInit() — for DOM-dependent logic after view init.

How do you bootstrap an Angular application?
  =>Bootstrapping an Angular application means initializing and loading the root module and component into the browser
    1. Main Entry Point – main.ts
      This is the starting point of any Angular app.

What is the difference between @Component, @NgModule, and @Injectable?
=>In Angular, these are decorators used to define the role of a class:
    @Component:
      Marks a class as an Angular component.
      Controls a piece of UI using a selector, template, and styles.
      Example: @Component({ selector: 'app-home', templateUrl: 'home.html' })
    @NgModule:
      Declares an Angular module that groups components, directives, and services.
      Handles app structure and configuration.
      Defines what gets bootstrapped, imported, and exported.
      Example: @NgModule({ declarations: [...], imports: [...] })
    @Injectable:
      Marks a class as injectable, typically for services.
      Allows Angular's dependency injection system to provide it.
      Example: @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })

What is the difference between BrowserModule and CommonModule?
=>-BrowserModule is used only in the root module (typically AppModule) and is required to run the Angular app in the browser. It provides services   
   essential for rendering and bootstrapping, and it also re-exports CommonModule.
  -On the other hand, CommonModule is used in feature modules or lazy-loaded modules. It provides common directives like ngIf, ngFor, and ngSwitch, 
   which are not available by default in those modules.

What is a template in Angular?
=>In Angular, a template is the HTML that defines the view of a component. It contains the layout and markup, along with Angular-specific syntax 
  like directives, bindings, and pipes to control how data is displayed and interacted with in the UI.

How do you use property binding and event binding in Angular?
=>property binding is used to bind data from the component to the view, and event binding is used to respond to user actions in the view.
  -Property Binding ([property]="expression"):<img [src]="imageUrl">
  -Event Binding ((event)="handler()"):<button (click)="onClick()">Click Me</button>

What are pipes in Angular? How do you create a custom pipe?
=> a pipe is a way to transform data before displaying it in the template. Pipes are used with the | symbol and are useful for things like 
   formatting dates, numbers, strings, etc.
    @Pipe({ name: 'capitalize' })
    export class CapitalizePipe implements PipeTransform {
      transform(value: string): string {
        if (!value) return '';
        return value[0].toUpperCase() + value.slice(1).toLowerCase();
      }
    }


✅ 2. Components and Templates (10 questions)
How do you create a component using Angular CLI?
=>ng g c name

What are the different ways to pass data to a component?
                  =>🔹 1. @Input() — Parent to Child Component
                          Used to pass data from a parent component to a child using property binding.
                          
                          Parent Template:
                          <app-child [message]="parentMessage"></app-child>
                          @Input() message: string;
                   🔹 2. @Output() — Child to Parent Communication
                          Used to send data from child to parent via EventEmitter.
                          
                          Child Component:
                          @Output() notify = new EventEmitter<string>();
                          
                          someMethod() {
                            this.notify.emit('Data from child');
                          }
                          Parent Template:
                  <app-child (notify)="handleNotify($event)"></app-child>
                  🔹 3. Service with Observable/Subject
                          Used to share data between unrelated components (e.g., siblings or across the app) via a shared service.
                          
                          @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
                          export class DataService {
                            private data = new BehaviorSubject<string>('initial');
                            currentData = this.data.asObservable();
                          
                            updateData(newValue: string) {
                              this.data.next(newValue);
                            }
                          }
                          Components can subscribe to currentData and get updates.
                          
                  🔹 4. Router Parameters / Query Params
                              Data passed through Angular routing.
                              
                              // Route config
                              { path: 'user/:id', component: UserComponent }
                              
                              // Accessing in component
                              this.route.snapshot.params['id'];
                  🔹 5. Template Reference Variables
                            Passing a DOM element or component reference using #ref.
                            
                            <input #myInput>
                            <app-child [inputElement]="myInput"></app-child>

What is @Input() and @Output() in Angular?

How do you use ng-content and content projection?
=>which means inserting content from a parent component into a child component's template
        Parent Component:
          <app-card>
            <p>This is projected content!</p>
          </app-card>
        Child Component (app-card):
          <div class="card">
            <ng-content></ng-content>
          </div>

What is a smart (container) vs dumb (presentational) component?
=>🔹 Smart (Container) Component:
      Handles business logic, data fetching, and state management
      Knows how to get the data
      Passes data to child (dumb) components via @Input()
      Handles events from child components via @Output()
      Typically connected to services, API calls, or the store
  🔹 Dumb (Presentational) Component:
      Only responsible for displaying data (UI)
      Gets data via @Input() and emits events via @Output()
      Doesn’t know where the data comes from
      Easier to test and reuse


What is ViewChild() and ContentChild()? When would you use each?
=>
    🔹 @ViewChild()
      -Used to get a reference to a child element, component, or directive that is part of the same component's template 
      -You use this when you need to call methods or access properties of a child component or DOM element declared in your template.
      <!-- app.component.html -->
      <app-child #childRef></app-child>'
      <!-- app.component.ts -->
      @ViewChild('childRef') childComponent: ChildComponent;
  🔹 @ContentChild()
    -Used to access projected content passed from a parent into a child component using <ng-content>.
    -This is useful when you're building reusable components and want to interact with content projected via ng-content.
    <!-- Parent component -->
    <app-card>
      <p #projectedContent>This is content from parent</p>
    </app-card>
    // app-card.component.ts
    @ContentChild('projectedContent') content: ElementRef;

What is the difference between template reference variable and ViewChild()?
Feature	                  Template Ref Variable      	@ViewChild()
Defined in  	            HTML template	            TypeScript class
Accessiblein	            Template only            	Component class (TS)
Lifecycle availability	  Immediately	              After ngAfterViewInit()
Use case	                Simple access (e.g., values)	Complex access (methods, properties)

How can you create a dynamic component?
=>In Angular, you can create a dynamic component at runtime using the ViewContainerRef and ComponentFactoryResolver or with the newer 
  createComponent() API. This is useful when you want to render components based on user input, configurations, or conditions.

✅ 3. Directives (8 questions)
What are directives in Angular?
=> directives are special classes that add behavior or modify the structure of elements in the DOM. They are used to extend HTML with custom logic.

          🔹 Types of Directives:
          Component
          Technically a directive with a template.
          Example: @Component({...})
          
          Structural Directives
          Change the layout of the DOM by adding or removing elements.
          Prefix: usually *
          Examples: *ngIf, *ngFor, *ngSwitch
          
          Attribute Directives
          Change the appearance or behavior of an existing element.
          Applied like regular attributes.
          Example: ngClass, ngStyle, or custom directives

Difference between structural and attribute directives?

Explain the usage of *ngIf, *ngFor, and *ngSwitch.

How do you create a custom directive?
=>ng generate directive highlight

✅ 4. Forms (8 questions)
What is the difference between reactive and template-driven forms?
=>
  🔹 1. Template-Driven Forms
  Form logic is written in the template using directives like ngModel.
      -Suitable for simple forms 
      -Uses two-way data binding      
      -Less code in the TypeScript file      
      -Asynchronous and declarative      
      -Requires FormsModule      
        Example:
        <form #form="ngForm">
          <input name="email" ngModel required>
        </form>
  🔹 2. Reactive Forms
  Form is defined in the TypeScript class, offering more control and predictability.
  Suitable for complex and dynamic forms
  Uses explicit form models (FormGroup, FormControl, FormArray)
  More scalable, testable, and synchronous
  Requires ReactiveFormsModule

    Example:
    form = new FormGroup({
      email: new FormControl('', [Validators.required, Validators.email])
    });
    <form [formGroup]="form">
      <input formControlName="email">
    </form>


How do you create and validate reactive forms?
=> you can create and validate Reactive Forms using FormGroup, FormControl, and built-in or custom validators from @angular/forms.
🔹 1. Import ReactiveFormsModule
🔹 2. Create the Form in Component Class
🔹 3. Bind the Form in the Template


How to implement custom validators in Angular?
=>Basic Custom Validator (Function)
    ✅ Example: Disallow spaces in a username
    import { AbstractControl, ValidationErrors } from '@angular/forms';
    
    export function noSpaces(control: AbstractControl): ValidationErrors | null {
      const hasSpace = (control.value || '').includes(' ');
      return hasSpace ? { noSpaces: true } : null;
    }
    ✅ Use in Component:
    username = new FormControl('', [noSpaces]);

What is FormGroup, FormControl, and FormArray?
=>FormControl: represents a single form input element and its value/state.
  FormGroup: is a collection of FormControls (or other groups/arrays) that allows us to manage a group of related fields together.
  FormArray:  is a collection of FormControls (or groups) stored in an array, useful when we want a dynamic number of form fields.”

How to handle nested forms in Angular?

How do you reset or patch values in a reactive form?
=>setValue() → updates all form fields, and requires every control to be specified.
  patchValue() → updates only specific fields, leaving others unchanged.
  reset() → clears the form, setting values back to initial state (optionally with defaults).”

How to dynamically add/remove form fields?
=>Explain form array

How to show form validation errors dynamically?

✅ 5. Services and Dependency Injection (8 questions)
What is a service in Angular?
=>A service in Angular is a class that contains business logic, reusable code, or data which can be shared across multiple components.
  It helps keep components lightweight and focused on UI, while services handle data fetching, state management, or utility logic.
  We usually create services with the @Injectable() decorator and provide them in root or a module, so Angular’s Dependency Injection (DI) system can share the same instance wherever it’s needed.

What is dependency injection in Angular?
=>Dependency Injection is a design pattern where Angular automatically provides required services or objects to a class instead of us creating them manually. This reduces tight coupling, improves    testability, and makes code cleaner. For example, when I inject UserService into a component’s constructor, Angular’s injector creates and provides the instance.

How do you provide a service in a specific module or component?

What is the use of providedIn: 'root'?
=>The @Injectable() decorator in Angular allows us to configure where a service should be registered with the Angular Injector.
  This is controlled by the providedIn property.
  Options:
  providedIn:'root'
      Service is registered in the root injector (AppModule level).
      Creates a single instance (singleton) shared across the entire app.
      Most commonly used.
  providedIn: 'platform'
      Service is registered in the platform injector.
      Shared across multiple Angular applications running on the same page.
  providedIn: 'any'
      Service is registered in any injector that requests it.
      A new instance will be created in each lazy-loaded module.
      Useful for isolating service state per module.


How does hierarchical injection work in Angular?

How to make a singleton service?

What are multi providers in Angular?
=>By default, when you provide a token (like a service) multiple times, the last one overrides the previous ones.
  But sometimes we want multiple values for the same injection token — that’s where multi providers come in.
        @Injectable()
        export class AuthInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {
        intercept(req: HttpRequest<any>, next: HttpHandler) {
            const cloned = req.clone({ setHeaders: { Authorization: 'Bearer token' } });
            return next.handle(cloned);
        }
        }

        @Injectable()
        export class LoggingInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {
        intercept(req: HttpRequest<any>, next: HttpHandler) {
            console.log('Request made:', req.url);
            return next.handle(req);
        }
        }



✅ 10. Performance Optimization (6 questions)
What is ChangeDetectionStrategy?OnPush and how does it work?
=> In Angular, change detection is the mechanism that checks for changes in component data and updates the DOM accordingly.
By default, Angular uses ChangeDetectionStrategy.Default, which means it runs change detection for the entire component tree whenever any event (like click, HTTP response, timer, input change) occurs.

How does Angular's change detection mechanism work?
=>Change Detection Flow
  Event happens (click, HTTP response, timer, etc.)
  Zone.js notifies Angular
  Angular runs change detection starting from root
  Components are checked one by one
  If a binding value changed → Angular updates the DOM
  If not changed → Skips DOM update (but still runs checks)
